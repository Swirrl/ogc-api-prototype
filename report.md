# Test data

Four datasets were selected from data created by the English Environment Agency to test the approach and provide real use cases for linking data together.

The datasets are available to download as compressed n-triples files from an Amazon S3 bucket:

## Ecology monitoring sites

This dataset contains monitoring sites where samples are taken to assess the population of invertebrates, diatoms and macrophytes. (These are managed in an Environment Agency system called 'Biosys'). The monitoring sites and associated data can be explored via a [web application](https://environment.data.gov.uk/ecology/explorer/).

Each monitoring site has a point geometry.
